Feature: collection buttons can be collapsed
	As an instructor
	I want to have a nicer user interface 
	So that I want to add a button that can expand or collapse collections  

Background:
	Given I am signed in with uid "1234" and provider "github"
	And I am on the CourseQuestionBank home page

# Scenario: collections can be expanded
#   When I press "toggle_more_collection_1_1" 
#   #I should see "collections-less-toggle"

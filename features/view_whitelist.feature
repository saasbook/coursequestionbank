#Feature: Admin can view a list of allowed Users on the app's whitelist
#  As an admin
#  So that I can manage access to the app
#  I want to see the current whitelist settings
#
#Background:
#  Given I am signed in with uid "1234" and provider "github"
#  And I am on the admin panel
#
#Scenario: Admin sees a list of whitelisted users
#  When I fill in "new-username" with "new_admin"
#  And I select "github" from "new-provider"
#  And I select "admin" from "new-privilege"
#  And I press "new-submit"
#  Then I should see "Whitelist updated"
#  And I should see "new_admin"
#
#
#Scenario: Admin can't change his own privilege
#  When I fill in "new-username" with "test"
#  And I select "github" from "new-provider"
#  And I select "instructor" from "new-privilege"
#  And I press "new-submit"
#  Then I should see "Can't change your own privilege level"
